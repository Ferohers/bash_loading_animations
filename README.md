# The ultimate collection of loading animations for Bash
Ready-to-use loading animations in ASCII and UTF-8 for easy integration into your Bash scripts.

**Have an idea for a nice-looking animation? [Please help expand the collection!](https://github.com/Silejonu/bash_loading_animations/issues/new?assignees=Silejonu&labels=enhancement&template=add-an-animation.yml&title=%5BNew+animation%5D+)**

âš  ***Important note:*** do not copy the raw file from your browser. Instead, use `git clone https://github.com/Silejonu/bash_loading_animations` or `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Silejonu/bash_loading_animations/main/bash_loading_animations.sh` to get the script. If you don't, **you will have broken animations**, as some non-breaking spaces will be converted into regular spaces.

## Include a loading animation in your script

Add the code between the two blocks that look like this to the top of your script:
```
#%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%#
#%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%#
#%% Add the code between this box and its twin to the top of your script %%#
#%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%#
#%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%#
```
You can safely remove the lines of the animations you're not interested in.

Chose your animation and its speed by editing the variables `active_loading_animation` and `loading_animation_speed` (more precise instructions are in the script).

*There is also a compact version of the code that fits in 4 lines, as well as an ultra-compact version that fits in a single (long) line.*

## Show the loading animation for a command
Simply do the following:
```
start_loading_animation
your_command_here
stop_loading_animation
```

If your command prints some output in the terminal, it will mess with the loading animation.

To hide all output, do the following: ```your_command_here &> /dev/null```

To hide error messages only, do the following: ```your_command_here 2> /dev/null```

To hide standard output only, do the following: ```your_command_here 1> /dev/null```

Some of the animations have been adapted from https://github.com/sindresorhus/cli-spinners.
